### How vue storefront works.

If you want to work with vue storefront then you have to understand its three concepts.

https://vuestorefront.io/blog/quick-vue-storefront-getting-started-guide#how-does-it-work

Vue storefront core :
The foundation for all the features that make Vue Storefront function is the Vue Storefront Core. All entry points, SSR behavior, build process, in-app libs, and helpers are contained in it. To continue receiving updates, you should not directly touch this folder when building your own implementations.

Vue storefront modules:

Each module consists of a single feature (like cart, wishlist, catalog, some third-party integration). You can assemble your Vue Storefront shop with only the functionality you require by adding, removing, or editing these modules as you see fit. They are employed for third-party extensions as well.
https://docs.vuestorefront.io/v1/guide/modules/introduction.html

Vue storefront themes :

The functionality from registered modules and the core can all be used and extended in themes, along with your own HTML markup and styles. Vue Storefront offers a default theme that is completely editable.






### Installing vue storefront :



Simply enter "yarn installer" in the project's root directory and respond to the prompts in the terminal to complete any of these tasks. To launch your project after installation is complete, type "yarn dev" (by default on port 3000). Whatever option you select, you can subsequently modify the configuration file's parameters.The installer will create the necessary configuration files when you use it to set up your Vue Storefront instance

#### Building themes in Vue Storefront
Most of the time, all you have to worry about when building themes for Vue Storefront is writing your own HTML and CSS markup. The core and its core modules expose all the necessary business logic, which can be simply inserted into any of the theme components.
By making a clone of the default theme and changing its name in its package, you can create your own theme quickly and easily. To create Lerna linking, edit the active theme in the config/local.json file, then run yarn (which we use for monorepos).

Offline mode and cache
vue  storefront also works in offline mode.



To display the material immediately while the user is online, vue storefront uses some of the cached data. Vue Storefront is extremely quick because of this.

At the end they have some useful link sections that include documentation , community slack invitation link , how to contribute etc. In the end they have a footer of user guide that include the same categories and subcategories which are in the navigation bar .Moreover, they also link their social media accounts in it .
